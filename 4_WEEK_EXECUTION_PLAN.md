# 🚀 4-WEEK EXECUTION PLAN: 140 → 200+ Followers
**Goal:** Build foundation for 10K growth | Find first 60 stranger-followers | Test shareable formats

---

## 📅 WEEK 1: Dec 8-14 (Foundation Week)

### **SUNDAY DEC 8 (TODAY) - 2 hours**

**Content Creation (90 min):**
- [ ] Edit NYC carousel (2-3 photos)
  - Photo 1: Vanderbilt Summit edge shot
  - Photo 2: Brooklyn Bridge beginning
  - Photo 3 (optional): Another NYC angle
- [ ] Write NYC caption (use Option 3 from conversation):
```
$39 for this NYC view (vs $50+ everywhere else) 🏙️

Vanderbilt Summit > Top of the Rock for one reason: NO LINES.

5 PM on a weekday = walked straight to the glass edge. This photo took 30 seconds.

Meanwhile, Edge has 45-min waits and costs $11 more.

Pro tips:
• Go 1 hour before sunset (5-6 PM in winter)
• Weekdays only (weekends still get packed)
• Glass walkout is included (don't skip it)

Swipe: Brooklyn Bridge at golden hour → start your walk at 5:30 PM, light hits perfect before crowds arrive.

Save this if you're planning NYC. Tag someone who needs to see this 👇
```

- [ ] Edit Grand Canyon reel (12 seconds max)
  - Use Script #4 structure: Photo (2s) → Transition (2s) → Video reality (8s)
  - Add text overlays: "Photos vs Being There" / "What you see" / "What it feels like"
- [ ] Research trending audio for reel (Instagram → Reels → Audio → Trending)
- [ ] Write Grand Canyon caption:
```
No camera does this justice 😳

Photos show the Grand Canyon. Being there shows you how SMALL you are.

That depth? That scale? You can't capture it. You have to feel it.

Free shuttle saved me parking fees. Sunrise at South Rim = almost empty.

What place surprised you most in person? 👇

## 📈 HOW TO TRACK PROGRESS

**Every Sunday, fill this out:**

| Week | Followers | Best Post | Saves | Shares | Strangers % |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1    | 155-165   | [reel or carousel?] | XX | XX | XX% |
| 2    | 170-180   | [type/topic] | XX | XX | XX% |
| 3    | 175-190   | [type/topic] | XX | XX | XX% |
| 4    | 185-205   | [type/topic] | XX | XX | XX% |

**Key metric: "Strangers %"**
- Week 1 goal: 20% of new followers are strangers
- Week 4 goal: 50% of new followers are strangers

---

## 🔥 FINAL REMINDERS

**Don't Panic If:**
- [ ] Likes drop from 38 → 30 in Week 1 (normal, family confused by format)
- [ ] Growth is slower than expected (60% of accounts grow slowly)
- [ ] One post flops (happens to everyone)

**Do Panic If:**
- [ ] Saves are still 0-2 after Week 2 (content not useful enough)
- [ ] No new strangers following by Week 3 (engagement strategy broken)
- [ ] You're skipping daily engagement (manual work is required)

**Celebrate If:**
- [ ] 15+ saves on any post (you found shareable format)
- [ ] 8+ shares on any reel (viral potential unlocked)
- [ ] 10+ new followers in one day (discovery working)
- [ ] Strangers commenting (building real community)

---

## 🎯 END OF WEEK 4 DECISION POINT

**If you hit 190+ followers:**
✅ Strategy is working
✅ Continue Month 2 with same format
✅ Scale to 3 posts/week if time allows
✅ On track for 10K by Month 12-15

**If you're at 160-189 followers:**
⚠️ Slow but steady growth
⚠️ Adjust content angles (more tips? more relatability?)
⚠️ Increase engagement to 20 comments/day
⚠️ Still viable, just slower timeline

**If you're under 160 followers:**
❌ Something's broken
❌ Review: Are posts getting saves? Are you engaging daily? Is audio trending?
❌ Consider pivot: Different niche? Different format?
❌ Schedule call with mentor/coach

---

**YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED.**

Content exists. Strategy is clear. Tools are ready.

Only question: Will you execute for 4 weeks straight?

Start today. Review Jan 5. Decide then.

🚀 LFG.
