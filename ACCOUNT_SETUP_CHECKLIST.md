2. Create 500x500px square
3. Fill with solid color (purple: #8B5CF6 or teal: #14B8A6)

### Select 9-12 Best Photos from Your Library

**Criteria:**
- Sharp focus (no blurry shots)
- Iconic landmarks (people recognize them immediately)
- Good lighting (golden hour, blue hour, or bright daylight)

9. _______________________________
10. _______________________________ (optional)
11. _______________________________ (optional)
12. _______________________________ (optional)

---

## STEP 6: Edit Grid Photos (20 minutes)

### Batch Edit in Instagram or Lightroom:

- [ ] Brightness: +10 to +20
- [ ] Contrast: +10 to +15

---

## STEP 7: Write Grid Captions (10 minutes)

### Caption Formula: "[Place Name]. [One-word verdict]."

**Examples:**
- Summit One. Breathtaking.
- Louvre. Overwhelming.
- Grand Canyon. Humbling.
- Eiffel Tower. Overrated.
- Big Ben. Iconic.
- Sacré-Cœur. Peaceful.
- Times Square. Chaotic.

### Your 9-12 Captions (Write Them Now):
1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________
4. _______________________________
5. _______________________________
6. _______________________________
7. _______________________________
8. _______________________________
9. _______________________________
10. _______________________________ (optional)
11. _______________________________ (optional)
12. _______________________________ (optional)

**DO NOT:**
- Use hashtags (looks spammy on new account)

### Option A: Post All at Once (Monday Dec 16, 9-10 AM)

4. This creates a carousel post OR post them individually in rapid succession

1. Go to business.facebook.com
2. Click "Create Post" → Instagram
3. Upload photo, write caption
4. Click "Schedule" → Set time: Dec 16, 9:00 AM

## Emergency Contacts & Resources

### If Something Breaks:

**Instagram won't let me schedule posts:**
- Reason: Account too new (needs to be 24 hours old)
- Fix: Wait 24 hours after creation, then reconnect Meta Business Suite

**Discord servers won't let me post links:**
- Reason: New member restrictions (need to be active 24-48 hours first)
- Fix: Post in #introductions first, wait 24 hours, then share in #feedback

**Reel stuck at low views (<50 after 6 hours):**
- Reason: High skip rate or wrong niche categorization
- Fix: Check Insights → Skip rate. If >80%, delete reel and post different hook.

**Engagement pod kicked me out:**
- Reason: Missed 3+ posts without notice
- Fix: Apologize, ask to rejoin, set calendar reminders for pod engagement.
