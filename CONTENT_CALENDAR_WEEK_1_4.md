## Week 5+ Content Ideas (After Jan 12)

**Once you hit 1,000 followers, you have options:**

**Option A: Keep viral formulas, add new locations**
- Use same 4 templates (Price Shock, This vs That, Controversy, Hidden Truth)
- New locations: Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Notre-Dame, Versailles, Buckingham Palace, Tower of London, etc.
- Can sustain for 3-4 more months with your content library

**Option B: Pivot to authentic storytelling**
- Longer reels (15-20 sec)
- Voiceover: "Here's why I love [place]"
- More personal, less clickbait
- Accept 30-40% follower loss (600-700 remain)

**Option C: Hybrid approach**
- Mon/Fri: Viral formulas (maintain reach)
- Wed/Sun: Authentic storytelling (build loyal audience)
- Best of both worlds

**Recommendation:** Option C (hybrid). Viral reels bring new followers, authentic content keeps them engaged.

---

## Emergency Pivot Scenarios

### If by Jan 5 (end of Week 3) you have:

**<200 followers:**
- **Problem:** Discord strategy failing OR reels not resonating
- **Fix:** Double Discord engagement (60 min/day), try different viral formulas (search "travel tips" instead of comparisons)

**<60% non-follower reach:**
- **Problem:** Instagram categorized wrong niche
- **Fix:** Delete lowest-performing reel, post new one with location tags + hashtags (#travel #museum #landmark)

**Skip rate >80% on all reels:**
- **Problem:** Hooks failing, footage boring
- **Fix:** Shorten reels to 4-5 sec, use faster cuts, add more text overlays

**0 saves on all reels:**
- **Problem:** Content not useful (people won't bookmark it)
- **Fix:** Pivot to "Hidden Truth" template only (saves = trip planning tool)

**Engagement rate <5%:**
- **Problem:** Engagement pods not working OR followers are bots
- **Fix:** Leave dead pods, join new ones, purge bot followers (Settings → Security → Remove suspicious followers)

---

## You Have Everything. Execute.

- ✅ 16 reels scripted (4 weeks of content)
- ✅ Posting schedule locked (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun 10 AM)
- ✅ Captions written (1 sentence, no overthinking)
- ✅ Audio strategy defined (trending travel sounds)
- ✅ Metrics tracking ready (Google Sheets table)
- ✅ Pivot plans in place (if something fails)

**All that's left:** Create the account and execute Week 1.

By Jan 13, you'll have 700-1,000 followers. Then decide: keep viral formulas or pivot to authentic content.
