## 50-Minute Lesson Plan

### Minutes 1-5: Introduction
- Show the game demo (Play Game tab)
- Explain the 4 roles
- Show that they're building a real game

### Minutes 6-15: Function Mini-Guide
- Have students read the Function Mini-Guide section
- Walk through one example with them
- Explain: def, parameters, return statements

### Minutes 16-40: Build Phase
- Assign students to 4-person teams
- Each person reads their role card
- Each person builds their Python file
- **You use Teacher Guide to:**
  - Help when they're stuck
  - Review their code
  - Answer questions

### Minutes 41-45: Integration
- All 4 files copied to same folder
- Students run: `python main.py`
- Watch their game play!

### Minutes 46-50: Debrief
- Celebrate working games
- Discuss:
  - What did they learn?

## Important Notes

### ✅ What's Already Done
- Mini-guide on functions (before examples)
- Playable game demo (in Play Game tab)
- Teacher's guide with all solutions
- Syntax highlighting on all code
- Professional styling
- Tab navigation system

### ⚠️ Remember to Tell Students

## During Class: Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "What do I write?"
**A:** Open the Instructions tab, find your role card. It says exactly what functions to write.

### Q: "How do I write a function?"
**A:** Read the Function Mini-Guide at the top of the Instructions tab. It shows the syntax.

### Q: "What should it return?"
**A:** Your role card says "Function should return..." Check the teacher guide for an example.

### Q: "I got an error."
**A:** Read the red text carefully. The teacher guide has a debugging section. You can also ask me!

### Q: "Can I see what it should do?"
**A:** Click the "Play Game" tab! See the game in action. That's what your code creates.

### Q: "My code works but different from teacher guide."
**A:** Great! As long as it works the same way, there are multiple correct solutions.
