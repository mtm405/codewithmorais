# üéØ QUIZ SYSTEM FIX VERIFICATION GUIDE

## Issue Resolved: Quiz Unlock Buttons Stuck on "Loading quiz..."

### ‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED

**Problem**: Quiz unlock buttons would show "Loading quiz..." and never restore their original state, appearing broken to users.

**Root Cause**: The basic `quiz_core.js` created earlier had insufficient button state management and didn't properly store/restore original button content.

**Solution**: Enhanced `quiz_core.js` with:
- `originalButtonTexts` Map to store original button HTML
- `restoreButton()` method to properly restore button state
- Improved `loadQuiz()` method that passes the source button for restoration
- Added demo quiz functionality to test the complete flow

### üß™ TESTING STEPS

1. **Navigate to lesson page**: http://localhost:5000/lesson/1_1
2. **Locate quiz unlock buttons**: Look for Easy, Medium, Hard buttons at bottom of lesson
3. **Test button click**:
   - Click any quiz unlock button
   - Button should briefly show "Loading quiz..." (1 second)
   - Button should restore to original text with token pill
   - Quiz modal should open with demo content

4. **Test quiz modal**:
   - Modal should display quiz information and demo question
   - "Start Demo Quiz" button should work
   - Demo question should be interactive
   - Submit answer should show result feedback
   - Close button should properly close modal

5. **Test button restoration**:
   - After closing modal, all buttons should be clickable again
   - Button text should show original "Easy/Medium/Hard" with token counts
   - Buttons should not remain disabled
