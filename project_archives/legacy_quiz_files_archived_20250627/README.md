This directory contains quiz-related files that have been replaced by the unified quiz system.

## Files Moved Here:

### JavaScript Files:
- **quiz_core.js** - Original quiz JavaScript logic (replaced by `consolidated_quiz_core.js`)
- **enhanced_quiz_core.js** - Enhanced version of quiz logic (consolidated into `consolidated_quiz_core.js`)

### CSS Files:
- **quiz_core.css** - Original quiz styles (replaced by `final_quiz_styles.css`)
- **enhanced_quiz_blocks.css** - Enhanced quiz block styles (consolidated into `final_quiz_styles.css`)
- **enhanced_quiz_blocks_v2.css** - Second version of enhanced quiz blocks (consolidated into `final_quiz_styles.css`)
- **enhanced_quiz_styles.css** - Modern quiz styles (consolidated into `final_quiz_styles.css`)
- **unified_quiz_styles.css** - Previous attempt at unified styles (replaced by `final_quiz_styles.css`)

## Current Active Files:

- **JavaScript**: `static/js/consolidated_quiz_core.js` - Unified quiz logic for all quiz types
- **CSS**: `static/css/final_quiz_styles.css` - **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all quiz styling

## Consolidation Summary:

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: We had 3 enhanced quiz CSS files causing conflicts and redundancy.

**SOLUTION**: Created `final_quiz_styles.css` that combines:
- Modern design system with CSS variables
- Dark mode support
- Comprehensive quiz type support (MCQ, Fill-in-blank, Drag-drop, etc.)
- Advanced animations and transitions
- Full accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Legacy class compatibility

## Date Consolidated:
June 27, 2025

These files are kept for reference and can be deleted after confirming the unified system works correctly.
